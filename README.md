## EDA

EDA is a critical step in the data analysis process because it sets the foundation for subsequent analysis and modeling tasks, helping analysts understand, clean, and derive insights from the data effectively.

- **Understanding the Data:**

      Gain insights into data structure, distribution, and characteristics.

      Identify patterns and trends within the dataset.

- **Identifying Relationships:**

      Uncover correlations and dependencies between variables.

      Visualize relationships through scatter plots and correlation matrices.

- **Detecting Anomalies and Outliers:**

      Identify unusual data points that may indicate errors or important deviations.

      Address anomalies early to ensure data quality and reliability.

- **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:**

      Identify and handle missing values, inconsistencies, and errors in the data.

      Ensure data integrity before proceeding with further analysis.

- **Feature Selection and Engineering:**

      Identify relevant features for analysis or modeling tasks.

      Explore potential new features through transformation or combination.
